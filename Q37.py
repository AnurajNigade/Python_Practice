# Letâ€™s say we have a group of N friends represented by a list of dictionaries where each value is a friend name and their location on a three dimensional scale of (x,y,z). The friends want to host a party but want the friend with the optimal location (least distance to travel as a group) to host it.

# Write a function pick_host to return the friend that should host the party.

# Example:

# Input:

# friends = [
# {'name': 'Bob', location: (5,2,10)},
# {'name': 'David', location: (2,3,5)},
# {'name': 'Mary', location: (19,3,4)},
# {'name': 'Skyler', location: (3,5,1)},
# ]

# def optimal_host(friends) -> 'David'
